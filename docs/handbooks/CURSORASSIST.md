# CursorAssist Handbook

Assistive cursor control and UI benchmarking. It’s adjacent to accessibility, but it’s more in the “motor assistance + UX measurement” lane.

## Quickstart

**Run**
```bash
cursor-assist --monitor
```

**Output**
* Cursor metrics CSV

## How it fits

* Can produce usability evidence/benchmarks that complement strict WCAG-style findings.
* If it emits structured outputs, it can be wrapped into `.a11y_artifacts/` as an additional evidence source.
